# DSA_LAB<br>
This repo contains 3rd semester vtu DSA lad set.

1]	Develop a Program in C for the following: 
a)	Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent 7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a particular day (A dynamically allocated String). 
b)	Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data from the keyboard and  to print weeks activity details report on screen. 
  
2. 	Develop  a Program in C for the following operations on Strings. 
a.	Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP) 
b.	Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in STR with REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in STR 
Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use Built-in functions.

3] 	Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on STACK of Integers 
(Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX) 
a.	Push an Element on to Stack 
b.	Pop an Element from Stack 
c.	Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome 
d.	Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack 
e.	Display the status of Stack 
f.	Exit 
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations

4] 	Develop a Program in C for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression.  Program  should  support  for  both  parenthesized  and free  parenthesized 
expressions with the operators: +, -, *, /, % (Remainder), ^ (Power) and alphanumeric operands.

5] 	Develop a Program in C for the following Stack Applications
a.	Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *, /, %, 
^ 
b.	Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks 

6. 	Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Circular QUEUE of 
Characters (Array Implementation of Queue with maximum size MAX) 
a.	Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE 
b.	Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE 
c.	Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Circular QUEUE 
d.	Display the status of Circular QUEUE 
e.	Exit 
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations

7] 	(SLL) o
PhNo 
a. 	Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Singly Linked List f Student Data with the fields: USN, Name, Programme, Sem, 
Create a SLL of N Students Data by using front insertion. 
	b. 	Display the status of SLL and count the number of nodes in it 
	c. 	Perform Insertion / Deletion at End of SLL 
	d. 	Perform Insertion / Deletion at Front of SLL(Demonstration of stack) 
	e. 	Exit

8] 	Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Doubly Linked List 
(DLL) of Employee Data with the fields: SSN, Name, Dept, Designation, 
Sal, PhNo 
a.	Create a DLL of N Employees Data by using end insertion. 
b.	Display the status of DLL and count the number of nodes in it 
c.	Perform Insertion and Deletion at End of DLL 
d.	Perform Insertion and Deletion at Front of DLL 
e.	Demonstrate how this DLL can be used as Double Ended Queue. f. Exit
